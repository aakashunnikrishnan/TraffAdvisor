#TrafficAdvisor
TrafficAdvisor is a project that utilizes the Google Maps API and machine learning algorithms to suggest alternative routes based on real-time traffic data. The project aims to help users navigate through heavy traffic or roadblocks by providing efficient and optimized route suggestions. By leveraging traffic prediction models, TrafficAdvisor enhances the accuracy of route recommendations, enabling users to make informed decisions about their travel plans.

##Features
Real-time Traffic Data: TrafficAdvisor fetches real-time traffic information from the Google Maps API, allowing users to access up-to-date traffic conditions.
Alternative Route Calculation: The project employs machine learning algorithms to calculate alternative routes based on the collected traffic data, taking into account factors like distance, estimated travel time, and traffic congestion.
User Customization: Users have the option to input their starting location, destination, and preferences (e.g., avoiding toll roads) to personalize the suggested routes according to their specific needs.
Predictive Traffic Block Analysis: TrafficAdvisor incorporates machine learning models to predict potential traffic blocks and congestion based on historical traffic data, enabling users to proactively plan their journeys.
Intuitive Interface: The project offers a user-friendly interface, presenting the suggested alternative routes along with relevant details such as distance, estimated travel time, and any notable traffic conditions. Visualizations may be utilized to enhance the user experience.
##Installation
To install and run TrafficAdvisor, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/traffic-advisor.git
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Obtain a Google Maps API key from the Google Cloud Platform Console and replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code with your actual API key.
Run the project using python app.py and access it through your browser at http://localhost:5000.
##Future Enhancements
TrafficAdvisor has the potential for further improvement and expansion. Some ideas for future enhancements include:

Incorporating real-time notifications for traffic incidents and accidents along the suggested routes.
Integrating additional data sources, such as weather conditions and road construction updates, to enhance the accuracy of route suggestions.
Offering multi-modal transportation options, considering public transportation routes and schedules alongside roadways.
Implementing user feedback mechanisms to collect data on actual traffic conditions and refine the predictive models.
